# TTS Attempts
This project is my attempt to create a application that will read out the data in your clipboard.
This is meant to be a portable tool that can work anywhere on your PC, as long as its in your clipboard, it can be read!
This project was built for windows and will likley not work on any other system type.



## How to use
Simply select the text you want to be read, then press: shift + a
- note, this will copy what you have selected in to your clipboard and clear it after.
- The selected text must also be on your active window, if you click to a different window, it will not work.

## Privacy
Having a application monitor your clipboard seems scary, however the clipboard is only read when the hotkey is pressed.
The clipboard data that is saved temporarily in a variable, is cleared after the clipboard has been read out.
